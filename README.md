## What it has.

By using the wonderful assets from the Unity Asset Store, I was able to create a real looking game. I firt assigned my ship a turning behavior with the ability to shoot missiles and emulate a star shooting game. My enemies have a consistant wave, and have utilize a custom path. I assigned particle effects and dissipation of them and I encorporated an infinite game with many possibilites to get powerups and shoot down enemies.

## What I learned from this Project

I learned quite a few things from this project. I learned how properly setup up a game and apply knowledge of previously learned technologies in Unity (ie: Canvas) for score counting. I applied my knowledge of Physics in the Game Engine to successfully be able to create shooting and projectile game. Overrall I am very excited to what more I can expand using the Unity Game Engine.
